# Yolov5_Instance_Segmentation
A step-by-step process for fine-tuning a YOLOv5 segmentation model on custom data


## Steps

1. **Fine-tune the model** over multiple epochs to adapt it to the custom dataset.
2. **Validate the model's performance** using a validation set to ensure accurate predictions.
3. **Make predictions** on both similar and less similar images within a video to test generalization.
4. **Explore ways to improve** the model's accuracy and performance, such as hyperparameter tuning, data augmentation, or active learning.
